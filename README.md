# Mask-Detection-Using-CNN

Description:

This repository contains the source code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to perform MASK Detection on the Face mask detection dataset. The model has been trained to achieve high accuracy on the validation set, and its generalizability is evaluated on the test set.

Key Features:
Leverages the power of CNNs for image recognition and classification.
Utilizes data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Incorporates regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
Employs dynamic learning rate adjustment for optimal performance.
Provides clear and concise code structure with detailed comments.
Includes comprehensive instructions for setup, training, and evaluation.
